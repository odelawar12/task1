Hello, i am done with the task that i have been provided with, i created flip cards that go into detail about 3 different car brands, Ferrari, Mercedes and Tesla.
Each card goes into detail about the car and its company, including different car models and the country of origin of the car and when the company was created.
I have also added a "Learn More" button at the buttom of the card that will directly redirect you to the companies website.
Here is the link for the CodeOpen site: https://codepen.io/Omar-Delawar/pen/zYMjBPX
